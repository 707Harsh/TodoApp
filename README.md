## Full Stack Todo application

I am creating a basic full stack Todo application, using NodeJs for backend, React for frontend, and mongoDB for database purposes.

## Setting up the project

To get all the necessary dependencies installed, run the following command in both the frontend as well as backend folder : 

```bash
  npm install
```
